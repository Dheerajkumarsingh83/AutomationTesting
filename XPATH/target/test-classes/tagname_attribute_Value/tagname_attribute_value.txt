XPath Selenium Locators Strategies
We can find the location of any element on a web page using XML path expressions. The basic syntax for XPath is
 shown below:

Syntax = //tagname[@attribute=’Value‘]

Example = //img[@alt=’Onur Baskirt‘]

You can also use class, and src attributes to locate an element with XPath, as shown above, but always check that 
only one element has been found!

Example:
//input[@type='send text']

//label[@id='clkBtn']

//input[@value='SEND']

//*[@class='swtestacademy'] --> "*" means, search "swtestacademy" class for all tags.

//a[@href='http://www.swtestacademy.com/']

//img[@src='cdn.medianova.com/images/img_59c4334feaa6d.png']
