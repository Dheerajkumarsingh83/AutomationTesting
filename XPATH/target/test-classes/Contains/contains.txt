Contains XPath in Selenium
It is a very handy XPath Selenium locator, and sometimes it saves the life of a test automation engineer. When an
 attribute of an element is dynamic, you can use contains() for the constant part of the web element but also use
  contains() in any condition when you need.

Syntax: //tag[contains(@attribute, ‘value‘)]

Example: //img[contains(@alt,’Baskirt’)]

//*[contains(@name,'btnClk')] --> It searches "btnClk" for all name attributes in the DOM.

//*[contains(text(),'here')] --> It searches the text "here" in the DOM.

//*[contains(@href,'swtestacademy.com')] --> It searches "swtestacademy.com" link in the DOM.
