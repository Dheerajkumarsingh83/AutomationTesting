Starts-with Xpath Examples
This method checks the starting text of an attribute. It is very handy when the attribute value changes dynamically,
 but you can also use this method for non-changing attribute values.

Syntax: //tag[starts-with(@attribute, ‘value‘)]

Example: //img[starts-with(@alt,’Onur Ba’)]
